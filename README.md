# Terminal Configuration Files

This repository contains my terminal settings

### Bashrc

Bashrc containing many aliases i used in daily life to make commands much easier.

### Conky.conf

Conky is a free software desktop system monitor for the X Window System. It is available for Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. I have configured it according to my taste.

### Bash script (sop.sh)

This script is used to remove older snap pakages which uses a lot of space and we donot need them so run the script with sudo and remove older linux pakages to free up space in your distro.

### Vimrc

vimrc contains the awesome vim editor environment.

### Git.md

This file contains basic git commands for a beginner to memorize the basics.
